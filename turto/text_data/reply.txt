<h3>Correction:</h3>

<ul>
<li>"Independence Days of Vietnam" &rarr; "Vietnam's Independence Day"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why:</h3>

<ul>
<li>"Independence Days" is plural, suggesting multiple independence days. Vietnam celebrates one main independence day.  "Vietnam's Independence Day" is grammatically correct and clearly indicates a single event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Natural version:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Today we have a school festival for Vietnam's Independence Day.</li>
</ul>
