<p>This is my sentence:</p>

<p>My friend, he is very kind.</p>

<h3>Correction:</h3>

<ul>
<li>"My friend, he is very kind" &rarr; "My friend is very kind."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The phrase "My friend, he..." is redundant.  "My friend" already functions as the subject of the sentence, so "he" is unnecessary.  It's like saying "My car, it is blue."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Natural version:</h3>

<ul>
<li>My friend is very kind.</li>
</ul>
