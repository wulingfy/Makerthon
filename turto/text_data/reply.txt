<p><strong>Correction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>"I doesn't like it" → "I don't like it"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As we discussed before, "doesn't" is used with "he," "she," and "it." With "I," we use "don't" (a contraction of "do not").</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Natural Version:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Did you hear me, Chat? I don't like it. (Adding a comma after "Chat" improves the flow and punctuation.)</li>
<li>Or:  Chat, did you hear me? I don't like it. (This version is slightly more emphatic.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Great job noticing your mistake! Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it.  Let me know when you have another sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong>
- "Are you hear me?" → "Can you hear me?" or "Do you hear me?"</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong>
- "Hear" is a verb meaning to perceive sound.  The sentence structure "Are you hear me?" is grammatically incorrect.  We need a verb that asks a question about the ability to hear. "Can" implies the ability to hear and "do" implies whether or not you are currently hearing.</p>

<p><strong>Natural versions:</strong>
- "Can you hear me?" (This is the most common and natural way to ask if someone can hear you.)
- "Do you hear me?" (This is a bit more forceful or emphasizes the need to be heard.)
- "Can you hear me okay?" (Adds politeness and checks for clarity)</p>
