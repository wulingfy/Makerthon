<p><strong>Correction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>"I doesn't like it" â†’ "I don't like it"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As we discussed before, "doesn't" is used with "he," "she," and "it." With "I," we use "don't" (a contraction of "do not").</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Natural Version:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Did you hear me, Chat? I don't like it. (Adding a comma after "Chat" improves the flow and punctuation.)</li>
<li>Or:  Chat, did you hear me? I don't like it. (This version is slightly more emphatic.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Great job noticing your mistake! Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it.  Let me know when you have another sentence.</p>
